(4.) Protest by Adam Formam, prior oi Dnnierrnline, and

bishop Jamee Bolon of St. Andrews, commendator
of lhe Monesbery, against e sentence of exeommuni-
oation for non-payment of a debr, dated ed May

ὅ. MS. Merehmont, Α Ο. 15, is evidently a 'copy of the pre-
ceding Me, and follows it in every particular. lt contains,
however, prefixed to the text of the narrative, the “ Praefaeio ''
and the “ Prologus '’ (pp. 3, 4 of this edition), and e Table of
(lonlents oi the first book, which are not to be found in any of
tha foregoing riser, and whioh were probably oopied from a lost
lael ol the Bodleian rrs. The Prologus entes that the work
was oompiled et the desim of the Abbor of Dunfermline.

This MS. hes on the first page lhe words, “Iioin Albinio?
and “liber Rieardi Bruni el amicorum;” and then, “Liber
Sanole merie de Neubolill, ex dono virorum venerabilium
domini Henrioi el domini J aoobi Herculi de Linlithq'.”² The
signatore, “ J. Gilmourf appears at the very top, though it is
soored oui and almost illegible.²
