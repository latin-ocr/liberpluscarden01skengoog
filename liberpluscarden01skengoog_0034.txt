tion oia word, possibly written out in full in the original, would
have been no guarantce that we have the author’s very word
and to have given all the different contractione of the same
word in the five several mss. would have added enormously
and unneceasarily ιο the bulk of the volume. In some casas
the transcribere themselves have evidently mistsken the con—
tractione of the original Any amcneous or various readings
arising from this or any other cause will be notioed attho end ol
a second volume. There hae been the less hesitation in adopt-
ing this method ol bald fidelity in editing this volume ss it will
be followed by a lhanslation, with Notas, in a second volume,
in which an attempt will ba made to exercise such discretion
and ingenuity as are usually expected ol one who has under-
taken to edit s corrupt text.

It has boen thought superfluous to print over again the first
live Books and the first lourteen chapters ol Book vt, as they
have already been given, almost verbatim, in M1.Skene's
Forulos and Goodall's Boccor. An Appendix to the Pteleos,
however, contains tha titles oi the chapters of this omitted por-
tion of the Chronicle, and shows the passages interpolated or
altered by our Authcr.

In conclusion, tha Editor wishes gratefully ιο aoknowledge
how much he is indebted ιο his uncle, Mr. William F. Skene,
for invaluable advice aud assistance. To Mr. Gillman he oves
some of tha work connected with the earlier part oi the volume,
aud many most useiul suggestions; and tc M. J oles Petit of
the Royal Library of Bruseels, scareful and intelligent collation
with tha Brussels ms. Ha also wishes to thank the gentlemen
who placed tha various uss. st hie disposui, and Mr. Bond oi
the Britieh Museum lor the ready courtesy with which he
always allowed the Editor arcese to those mss. which were
intrusted to his keeping.

FELIX SKENE.
