from Bale and written into the Bodleian ue. by Fairlax, aud the
parenthetical assertion of Fairtax that Bishop Elphiustone was
, the author, thie compilation has always, until lately‚ been attri-
buted to Bishap liiphimtone oi Aberdeen;1 but our author tells
us in the Prologus that he knew doen cf Arc, who died in 1430,
while Biehop Elphinstone was not horn till the year 143⁷.

Not long ago, however, Mr. W. F. Skene, in a paper read be-
fore the Society 'of Antiquaries at E'rdinburgh,² brought forward
a theory which seems very satisfactorily to meet all the difficul-
tiee of the question His argument is briefly aa follows :-

“ In endeavouring to ascertain who the anonymous author of
thie unpublishcd history really was, we have, first, to put
together all the indicatione affordcd by the work iteell; aud,
secondly, to examine whether the same marks apply to the
history of any Soet who was in Franco at the period above
indicatori

“ The indicatione aliorded by the ress. are as follows :- ,

“ I. The author was in France during the period when the
Maid of Orleana played her part, knew her persenally, and was
present at her deathiu 1430. ·

‘⁸ II. He was' also in Franco during the life cl the Princese
Margaret ol Sootland aiter her' marriage with the Dauphin‚ and
was in a position which brought him into daily intercourse
with her.⁸ ¹
