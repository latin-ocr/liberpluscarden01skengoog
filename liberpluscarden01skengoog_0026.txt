(6.) Some Latin lines on Princess Margaret’s marriage
with dames IV. in 1503.

(⁷.) Rough draftofan accountin Latin of how the monastery

been trodden down during the coronation ol Rcbsrt 111.

(8.) Beginning of 6 dead dated 1506, by some Abbot

· 6. MS. Bibliothhque Royale, Brnssels, No. 1396, also is 6

copy 61 6116 Bodleian 111.,11116 contains the “Praefacio’' end

“ Prologus,” and the letter part seems to be in the sama hand·

writing es 6116Μ616111116116116.1

All these 1116. bnt tha Carere, which is a folio, are quartos,

written on peper, the Glesgow 111. end its two copies across

the page, end the Bodleian and its two copies in double

columns.

It would thus seem, 116111 euch evidence as istumished by · l

the 1116. themselves, thet the Chronicle was compiled in 1461
161 Richard Bothuele, then Abbot of Dunfermlina

The original 111. seems to be no longer extant, butis repre·
sented by two principal 1166, both probably immediate tren·
scripte of it: (1.) the Glesgow 111, 6 faithful copy written
probably bys Frenchman, between 1411 and 1466, 161 Willism
Schevez, Archbishop of St. Andrews, passing about 6116 middle

a sonvcnt pris la pioque ;” and it is a slight coincidence that among 1116116-
joie’s verses in 6116 Μ116111116116 111. aramme “ Metrs magni Thurci a papa
Alexandro? Moreover thepasssge ‘⁴ 66 161 1111611161 ds plusianus auditeurs,”
166116 beginning ol 6116 Prologue,ia Domat's translation oi “st multorum
aures audiencinm,’¹ 61 6116 passage stands in this rra, and 1166 61 “ 66 mul·
centur aures audiencium.” 11 16 11 given in the Bmissels rra

From 611616 slender indicatione we may perhaps surmise that 61111111.
passed into the possession 61 Montjoie, the French Rei d'Arrnes‚ and was
the very text 116111 which Domst made his translation in 16111. The words
“ Licin Albinic‚” which it 11 difficult 66 16666116 161, may be in 161116 way
connected with this cpisode in the history 61 6116111.

The promised history oi Joan oi Arc 11111 6116 suthor’s 1111116 are wanting
in Domst’s translation, as in 111 6116 Latin 1111.
